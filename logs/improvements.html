<!-- Description -->
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">This is a log with a list of ideas or suggestions for improving the project.&nbsp; This includes identifying bugs in the project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the project that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new features for the simulator.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<b>Project 1</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Spelling errors present in project documentation.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Project 2 -->
<b>Project 2</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>No suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Project 3 -->
<b>Project 3</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>A significant amount of time has been spent putting the given HTML files in a format that is easy to read and navigate. This includes placing comments throughout the HTML files and formatting text such that it can be read easily. See all edited versions of these design files for examples.<br><b>NOTE:</b> If you want to move forward with this idea, I (Daniel Santoro // ddsantor) may be willing to reformat all standard HTML portfolio files.</li>
	<li>Either provide event triggered requirements examples (instead of time-triggered ones) or get rid of the event-based requirements as part of the project.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Project 4 -->
<b>Project 4</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>No suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Project 5 -->
<b>Project 5</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>The packages could be better organized and duplicated classes can be removed in order not to confuse developers.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Project 6 -->
<b>Project 6</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Sensor naming is not consistent.. For example, DoorClosed related names all use the word "Closed" but for DoorOpen, some things use "Open" and some use "Opened".</li>
  <li>The word "SENSOR" should be added to all CAN_ID macros. Currently AtFloor does not have "SENSOR" in it, but it is in both DoorOpen and DoorClosed.</li>
  <li>For Unit/Integration tests, either (1) allow multiple assertions per line or (2) throw an error when there are multiple assertions on a line. The documentation was ambiguous as to the fact that you cannot assert multiple things per line, and thus this was a source of some lost time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>No suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Project 12 -->
<b>Project 12</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>The data shown for hours spent in a given week is always per student. I am interested in a per group metric.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Project 13 -->
<b>Project 13</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Number the portfolio directories so that they are sorted roughly in the same order as the process, rather than in alphabetical order.</li>
</ul>
<!-- General Project Comments -->
<b>Overall Project Comments</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Rahul Ramesh // rahulram: This project is one of the most interesting things I've done. The class teaches good process, and I believe it builds useful work skills. Something that might help students even more would be to have some sort of rewind or jump to functionality in the elevator gui.</li>
  <li>Daniel Santoro // ddsantor: This has been the best structured class I've taken at CMU. Unlike other classes can be, group dynamic for this project is key. There is too much work to have group members not producing anything meaningful.</li>
  <li>David Thompson // davidtho: I have been very impressed by how well-tuned this project has been, given its scale.  All major pieces of the project felt appropriate. Pacing was consistent overall, although the transition to the second half of the project was very heavy. I wonder if it might be possible to compress the first half of the project by a week without it being overwhelming; Perhaps abbreviate the event-triggered section?</li>
  <li>Jialiang Tan // jialiant: I like the flow of the project. The pace of the project is just perfect. One thing that would help is to fix the state assertion bug such that the tests could be done more efficiently and easily.</li>
</ul>
